# Analysis:
The dashboard represents analysis of Violent and Non-Violent Crimes based on socio-economic factors. For the purpose of analysis, we have used features pertaining to Education, Unemployment and Poverty. In the dashboard we measure these features as follows:
Poverty has been measured as the average percentage of the population under poverty.
Education is measured in 2 levels, the population without a high school degree and the population with at least a Bachelor’s degree.
Unemployment is measured as the average percentage of unemployed population for a given state.
Each circle in the 3 scatter plots represents a state in the United States


# Results: 
## Poverty vs Crimes:
There are higher non violent crimes than violent crimes and they both increase with an increase in the percentage of population under poverty.
 
## Education vs. Crime:
The number of non-violent crimes per 100k population increase regardless of the percentage of people educated in the state. However, the number of violent crimes per 100k population decreases as a higher proportion of the state’s population earns at least a bachelor’s degree.
 
## Unemployment vs. Crime:
The number of violent and non-violent crimes per 100k population increase with an increase in the percent of the state’s unemployed population.

## Non-violent crimes per violent crime vs. State:
The map chart depicts the rate of non-violent crimes per violent crime for each state. The ratio is highest for the state of Nevada which means, the state experiences a lot more non-violent crimes compared to violent crimes.
